# Overview
This is intended to be a fully custom, easily expandable image processing application that I can use to explore and implement random and fun things I learn!
# Installation
I will likely use GitHub actions to create .exe for each version... I know of this but I don't know how to do it yet so that will come later once I have a 'product' to release.
# Documentation
I am currently in the development phase so there is no documentation...
